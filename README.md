Writing programs that are maintainable, readable and adaptable means that you can take a part of your program and implement it in another one. For instance, my CRUD python moddule can be used with probably most mongoDB projects, it's very basic but it is able to at a baseline create, read, update, delete, which are needed the most when interacting with a database in anyway. As a computer sacientist you want to solve problems by creating solutions that can be applied to other problems, albeit sometime modified, no one wants to reinvent the wheel on every issue.
